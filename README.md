# Project-Feedster
tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript(JQuery)

This project was created to show the user the text area limit of 140 characters. The character counter decreases as the user types, It will turn red once the user has gone past the character limit.

I enjoyed making this little project, if I did it again I would add more functions like having bloggers comments over 50 characters slide down when mouse hovers over the profile comment.
